### Solution 1:
with cte as(
select 
	client_id,
	driver_id,
    status, 
    request_at
from 
	trips t
join 
	users u on t.client_id = u.users_id and u.banned = 'No'
join 
    users u1 on t.driver_id = u1.users_id and u1.banned = 'No'),
cte1 as (
select 
    request_at,
    count(status) cancel
from 
    cte 
where 
    status != 'completed'
group by 
    request_at)
select 
    request_at Day,
    ifnull(round(cancel /count(*),2),0) 'Cancellation Rate'
from 
    cte 
left join 
    cte1 using(request_at)
where 
    request_at between '2013-10-01' and '2013-10-03' 
group by 
    request_at
    
    
    
### Solution 2:
with cte as(
select 
    id,
    request_at,
    if(status !='completed',1,0) cancel
from 
    trips t 
join 
    users u1 on t.client_id = u1.users_id and u1.banned = 'No'
join

where 
    request_at between '2013-10-01' and '2013-10-03')
select 
    request_at Day,
    round(sum(cancel)/count(id),2) 'Cancellation Rate'
from 
    cte
group by 
    request_at
order by
