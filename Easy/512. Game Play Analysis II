### solution 1 ###
### with CTE to find the min event_date 

with cte as(
SELECT 
    player_id,
    min(event_date) min_date
from 
    activity 
group by 
    player_id)

on 
    cte.player_id = a.player_id 
    and 
    cte.min_date = a.event_date
    
    
### solution 2 ###  
### with row_number 
select
