## logic
1. when [# of distinct products purchased by the customer = # of count(distinct product)] -->  the customer is considered to buy all products
2. find the customer_id  


## code 
with c1 as(
select
    customer_id,
    count(distinct product_key) cn_pro
from 
    customer 
group by
    customer_id),
c2 as(
select 
    count(product_key) full_cn_pro
from 
    product)
select 
    customer_id
from 
    c1
join 
    c2 on c1.cn_pro = c2.full_cn_pro
